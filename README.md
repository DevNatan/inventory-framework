**IF** (**I**nventory **F**ramework) is a Bukkit Inventory API framework that allows you to create custom inventories
with varied interaction treatments that would be almost impossible to create manually by the developer.

We provide to you with extra inventory manipulation functionality, common code for creating inventories of different types,
resolution and detection of known platform issues that are resolved internally, high-level secure and robust API.

Works for Minecraft versions 1.8-1.19 (see [Versions Compatibility](https://github.com/DevNatan/inventory-framework/wiki#versions-compatibility))
