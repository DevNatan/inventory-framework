Bukkit inventory framework used in some of my projects, feel free to use it. Learn by yourself.

Currently, inventory-framework should support any minecraft versions due to its compatibility with Bukkit.\
If there's any issue with a different minecraft version, please report it in [Issue Reporting](https://github.com/DevNatan/inventory-framework/issues) section.

## Setup
Before get started, make sure you have the [JitPack repository](https://jitpack.io) included in your build configuration.

Gradle
```groovy
dependencies {
    compileOnly 'com.github.DevNatan:inventory-framework:2.3.2'
}
```

Gradle (Kotlin)
```kotlin
dependencies {
    compileOnly("com.github.DevNatan:inventory-framework:2.3.2")
}
```

Maven
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.DevNatan</groupId>
    <artifactId>inventory-framework</artifactId>
    <version>2.3.2</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
```

## Preventing Library Conflicts
There is a good chance that the inventory-framework library will be used in different plugins within your server, 
these plugins share the same classpath, if a plugin is using a different version of the IF compared to the others 
there will be a **version conflict because it has been shaded** inside that plugin.

To prevent this, we always provide the library in plugin format (.jar) to be placed in your plugins folder and used by all your plugins.

Add the inventory framework as a dependency of your plugin to be able to access it.
```yaml
depend: [InventoryFramework]
```

**You can install the latest version of the InventoryFramework on the [Releases tab](https://github.com/DevNatan/inventory-framework/releases) on Github.**

## How to use
Our view is a simple inventory, with a title and a list of items.
You must extend the View class and override its constructor, which contains the following parameters:
* **rows**: the number of lines the inventory will have.
* **title**:  the inventory title.

Let's create an inventory with 3 lines and a cool title. It's simple.
```java
public final class MyView extends View {
    
    public MyView() {
        super(3, "Scooter Turtle");
    }
    
}
```

To put items in inventory, you can put them in the view constructor using the `slot` method.
There are variations of this method you can use, such as:
* `slot(number)` at a specified position
* `slot(row, column)` in the `row` and the `column` of the inventory.
* `firstSlot()` in the first inventory slot.
* `lastSlot()` in the last inventory slot.

```java
public final class MyView extends View {
    
    public MyView() {
        super(3, "Scooter Turtle");
        
        slot(1, ItemStack);
        slot(3, 5, ItemStack);
        firstSlot(ItemStack);
        lastSlot(ItemStack);
    }
    
}
```

### Click handler
Of course you want to run functions when an item is clicked, you can use the `onClick(ViewContext)` handler for that.

The example below will display a message when the player clicks on the diamond.
```java
public final class MyView extends View {
    
    public MyView() {
        super(3, "Scooter Turtle");
        
        slot(1, new ItemStack(Material.DIAMOND))
            .onClick(context -> context.getPlayer().sendMessage("Clicked on a Diamond."));
    }
    
}
```

> Notice that you now have a `context` parameter of type `ViewContext`, which contains context information for the player currently accessing the inventory.

### Rendering function
In the constructor, you don't have the player object that is viewing the inventory available if you want to use it (unless you use the item's rendering functions, which we'll explain later) so we need to use our view's `onRender` rendering function to get that.

```java
public final class MyView extends View {
    
    public MyView() {
        super(3, "Scooter Turtle");
    }
    
    @Override
    public final void onRender(final ViewContext context) {
        // ...
    }
    
}
```

Any function present in the constructor can be used through the `ViewContext`, both of which extend `VirtualView` which provides the methods.
The difference is that these functions **will only apply to the player in that context**.

With that, we can send a message to the player when the inventory is rendered for him.
```java
public final class MyView extends View {
    
    public MyView() {
        super(3, "Scooter Turtle");
    }
    
    @Override
    public final void onRender(final ViewContext context) {
        final Player player = context.getPlayer();
        player.sendMessage("Hi, " + player.getName() + "!");
    }
    
}
```

## Registering our views
After making our view, we need to register it.
```java
public final class MyPlugin extends JavaPlugin {
    
    private ViewFrame viewFrame;
    
    @Override
    public void onEnable() {
        // first, initialize our facade class to store our views, contexts and data.
        viewFrame = new ViewFrame(this);
        
        // register our view.
        viewFrame.register(MyView.class); // We register our view.
    }
    
}
```

> The `register` function can only be called once! If you want to dynamically register views use `addView` instead.

To open our view, we need to call the facade method.
```java
// opens "MyView" to the player.
viewFrame.open(MyView.class, player);
```

## Context data
You also open to a specific player with specific data.
This data will be available for as long as the player has an open inventory, or until it is cleared.
```java
final Map<String, Object> data = new HashMap<>();
data.put("my-data", "My value");

//open to the player with specific data.
viewFrame.open(MyView.class, player, data);
```

And then, we use it in our view:
```java
// get the data from the context which was passed to the open method.
final String data = context.get("my-data");
```

You can also set a data value during the life of the view.
```java
context.set("my-data", value);
```

And clean it anytime you want too.
```java
context.clear("my-data");
```

> **Context data is transitive!** Any handler that contains a context in that specific View will inherit data from other contexts. 

## Close
To close an inventory view you can use `View.close`, but pay close attention... This will close the inventory for all players who have been viewing that inventory.
```java
view.close();
```

You can only close the inventory given to a player if you have his context in hand.
```java
context.close();
```

## Version Compatibility
InventoryFramework was initially developed only for version 1.8.8, but over time support for newer versions has been added.

Here is the compatibility table, see if your version is compatible before trying to use the library.

| Minecraft version | Supported since | Status        | Notes |
|-------------------|-----------------|---------------|-------|
| 1.8               | v1.0            | ✅ Supported   |       |
| 1.9–1.15          |                 | ⚠️ Not tested |       |
| 1.16              | v2.3            | ✅ Supported   |       |
| 1.17              | v2.3.2          | ✅ Supported   |       |
| 1.18              | v2.3.2          | ✅ Supported   |       |

## Examples
#### View using rendering function and click handler
```java
public class MyView extends View {
    
    public MyView() {
        super(3, "My view"); // 3 views per page with title "My view"
    }
    
    @Override
    public final void onRender(final ViewContext context) {
        // We can get the player from inventory.
        Player player = context.getPlayer();
        
        // We put the Stone in slot 14. (we written 14 because our slots starts at 1)
        context.slot(14, new ItemStack(Material.STONE));
        
        // Also, we can put the Stone in row 1, column 5.
        context.slot(1, 5, new ItemStack(Material.STONE));
        
        // We can also put the Stone in row 3, column 5.
        ViewItem myItem = context.slot(3, 5, new ItemStack(Material.STONE));
        
        // We can add a click event.
        myItem.onClick(() -> {
            player.sendMessage("You clicked on the stone!");
        });
    }
}
```

There's a lot of things you can do with inventory-framework, but for now, we'll just use the simple one.
You can make paginated pages, refreshing items and schedule tasks inside each view.
